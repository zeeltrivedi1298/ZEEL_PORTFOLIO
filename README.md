This websites dynamic background was created using the Threejs library. The center planet, its wireframe halo and the tetrahedron 'asteroids' are all rendered seperately and animated with random offsets and rotations that are different each time the site is loaded. The layout is a single column design of flexboxes that contain reactive content cards.
